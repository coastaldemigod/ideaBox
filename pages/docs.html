            So what is ideaBox?

            It's a project aimed at connecting people with ideas, students who want buddies to work on projects, people who are looking for teammates for hackathons.
        Basically, anyone with an idea looking for someone to help/aid/mentor in their idea.

        <div class="que">
            So, if I put my million dollar idea in this ideaBox wouldn't it get stollen/copied ?
        </div>
        <div class="ans">
            <br>
            NOPE, Because it's not about the idea, it's about the execution.
            <br>Let me explan... 
            <br>
            <br>What is flipkart doing? It's just an online retail marketplace. A really simple idea.
            <br>What is lenskart doing? It just sells spectacles online. A really simple idea.
            <br>What is paytm doing? It's just makes transactions happen online. A really simple idea.
            <br>What is zomato doing? It's just a food delivery service. A really simple idea.
            <br>
            <br>If you look closely, none of these ideas are extraordinary, they are really simple ideas.
            <br>what is in an online marketplace, or selling specs online, or doing transactions online or delivering food that you cannot think.
            <br>People bought things online before flipkart too, people did online transactions a lot before paytm, restraunts delivered foods from a long time ago.
            <br>
            <br>What these startups had, was not a great idea or a million dollar idea, but a great execution.
            <br>Figuring out the "what" is the easy part, figuring out the "HOW" is the tricky part.
            <br>That's where "ideaBox" comes in. 
            <br>
            <br>This project aims at finding people who can help you execute that idea. 
            <br>Turn that idea into code.

            <br><div class="high">Because in the end, it's the execution that matters.</div>
